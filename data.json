      "strInstructions": "step 1\r\nFinely chop the peppers in a food processor, then tip them in a sieve and press into the sieve so that the peppers release all of their juices. Tip into a bowl along with the mince, red pepper paste, pul biber, 1\u00bd tsp flaky sea salt, and 2 tbsp of the oil. Mix together, kneading well for at least 2-3 mins. If you need to, wet your hands with cold water to prevent the mixture from sticking. The mixture should be sticky when ready. Cover and chill for at least 2 hrs, or up to 12 hrs.\r\n\r\nstep 2\r\nWhen ready to cook, heat the grill to high or an oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 6. Divide the mixture into 12 equal portions, around 85g each. If you\u2019d like to skewer them, divide into 8 equal portions and roll into balls. Using wet hands, thread the balls onto the end of the skewers, massaging the mixture down the skewers in between the palms of your hands, until evenly distributed. Ensure that the mixture is fully wrapped tightly around the skewers without any exposed metal. Alternatively, lay them on a large baking tray lined with parchment paper if cooking in the oven, or foil if cooking under the grill. Shape into 20cm-long k\u00f6fte. Wet your fingers with a little cold water and make indents all along the k\u00f6fte for the traditional shape.\r\n\r\nstep 3\r\nGently brush each k\u00f6fte with the remaining 1 tbsp oil and cook under the grill, on the top shelf for 10-12 mins, turning regularly, or cook in the oven for 16-18 mins, until crispy on the outside and juicy in the middle",

      "strInstructions": "Preheat your oven's broiler. Place red bell peppers and tomatoes on a baking sheet, and roast under the broiler for about 8 minutes, turning occasionally. This should blacken the skin and help it peel off more easily. Cool, then scrape the skins off of the tomatoes and peppers, and place them in a large bowl. Remove cores and seeds from the bell peppers.\r\n\r\nHeat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the jalapenos and garlic, and cook until tender, stirring frequently. Remove from heat, and transfer the garlic and jalapeno to the bowl with the tomatoes and red peppers. Using two sharp steak knives (one in each hand), cut up the tomatoes and peppers to a coarse and soupy consistency. Stir, and set sauce aside.\r\n\r\nPlace the semolina in a large bowl, and stir in salt and 4 tablespoons of olive oil. Gradually add water while mixing and squeezing with your hand until the dough holds together without being sticky or dry, and molds easily with the hand. Divide into 6 pieces and form into balls.\r\n\r\nFor each round, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Roll out dough one round at a time, to no thicker than 1/4 inch. Fry in the hot skillet until dark brown spots appear on the surface, and they are crispy. Remove from the skillet, and wrap in a clean towel while preparing the remaining flat breads.\r\n\r\nTo eat the bread and sauce, break off pieces of the bread, and scoop them into the sauce. It will slide off, but just keep reaching in!",

Brown patties in batches in the hot skillet until crispy on both sides and no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes. Set meatballs aside in a rimmed serving dish.\r\n\r\nReduce heat to medium and stir remaining chopped onion into drippings in the skillet. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in remaining garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Stir in Roma tomatoes, dried parsley, and ras el hanout. Pour in water. Cook until tomatoes are soft, about 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nPour tomato sauce over meatballs to serve.",

Mix in the eggs, then add the ground almonds and almond extract and blend until well combined.\r\nPeel the apples, and cut thin slices of apple. Do this at the last minute to prevent the apple going brown. Arrange the slices over the biscuit base. Spread the frangipane filling evenly on top. Level the surface and sprinkle with the flaked almonds.\r\nBake for 20-25 minutes until golden-brown and set.\r\nRemove from the oven and leave to cool for 15 minutes. Remove the sides of the tin.

Add the remaining oil to the pan and lower the heat to medium, then add the black pudding and bacon and fry all over for several mins. Remove with a slotted spoon. Fry the onion and peppers for around 10 mins until soft and pale gold, then add the tomato and cook until soft. Add the garlic, smoked paprika and chilli flakes and cook for another 2 mins, then put the pork, black pudding and bacon back in the pan. Add the beans, stock and whichever herb you're using, and bring everything to the boil.\r\n\r\nstep 2\r\nSprinkle the rice around the pork belly, pushing it underneath the stock. Let the stock come to the boil again, season well, then transfer to the oven (leave it uncovered). Cook for 20 mins without stirring, then check to see how the rice is doing. The rice should be tender and the stock absorbed. If it\u2019s not ready, put back in the oven for another 5 mins, then check again. Taste for seasoning.\r\n\r\nstep 3\r\nSqueeze lemon juice over the top and drizzle over some extra virgin olive oil just before serving, if you like.",

Add chorizo and morcilla after the beef has been cooking for a while.\r\nCook to Perfection: Cook the meat, turning occasionally, until it reaches your desired doneness. Typically, ribs may take up to 2 hours; thinner cuts will cook faster.\r\nRest and Serve: Let the meat rest for about 10 minutes before slicing. Serve with chimichurri sauce and grilled vegetables.\r\nPro Tips:\r\n\r\nUse a mix of wood and charcoal for a consistent heat source. Wood adds flavor, while charcoal maintains temperature.\r\nSeason the meat just before grilling to ensure it retains its moisture and flavor.\r\nServing Suggestions:\r\n\r\nServe with a side of chimichurri sauce, a fresh tomato salad, and crusty bread. Pair with a robust Malbec wine to complement the rich flavors of the meat.",

      "strInstructions": "In a blender, add the ingredients for the spice paste and blend until smooth.\r\nOver medium heat, pour the spice paste in a skillet or pan and fry for 10 minutes until fragrant. Add water or oil 1 tablespoon at a time if the paste becomes too dry. Don't burn the paste. Lower the fire slightly if needed.\r\nAdd the cloves, cardamom, tamarind pulp, coconut milk, water, sugar and salt. Turn the heat up and bring the mixture to boil. Turn the heat to medium low and simmer for 10 minutes. Stir occasionally. It will reduce slightly. This is the marinade/sauce, so taste and adjust seasoning if necessary. Don't worry if it's slightly bitter. It will go away when roasting.\r\nWhen the marinade/sauce has cooled, pour everything over the chicken and marinate overnight to two days.\r\nPreheat the oven to 425 F.\r\nRemove the chicken from the marinade. Spoon the marinade onto a greased (or aluminum lined) baking sheet. Lay the chicken on top of the sauce (make sure the chicken covers the sauce and the sauce isn't exposed or it'll burn) and spread the remaining marinade on the chicken. Roast for 35-45 minutes or until internal temp of the thickest part of chicken is at least 175 F.\r\nLet chicken rest for 5 minutes. Brush the chicken with some of the oil. Serve chicken with the sauce over steamed rice (or coconut rice).",
